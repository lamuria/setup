## Setup

This repo uses [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install all the applications I need
in a clean Mac. It installs some development tools and then makes use of
[homebrew-cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask) to install the the
remaining general purpose applications I use.

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:quimrstorres/setup.git
script/bootstrap
```
